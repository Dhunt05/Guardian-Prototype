# Guardian-Prototype

Ever wanted to fly a Guardian? well now you can!

This mod adds a separate Guardian that has a bridge built on to it, it comes with a blueprint, it has the Automated ship hull mod removed so the player can fly it.
It is 80dp to field instead of the normal 40dp because its keeping its autoforge and will be WAY stronger in the players hands, also its 1.5mil to build.

ChangeLog-
1.3- Added 3 new variants of the Guardian
Full Energy variant 60dp 1mil to build
Full Ballistic variant 60dp 1mil to build
Full Missile variant 160dp 3.5mil to build

1.1 updated mod name to Guardian Prototype from "Human Guardian"

Credits for both mods:
Yunru- For making the mod
YuiTheModder- For doing all the sprite work.
